## R1 D1

- Today I'll try my best to complete the stuff that i already know over on freecodecamp like responsive design, accessibility etc. and try my best to do most of the front end stuff but it's probably gonna take longer than a day so yeah I'm gonna commit.

- Okay so yesterday i managed to finish the topics from Applied Visual Design to CSS Grids which tbh i could have done more since i already know these things but oh well.

- Okay so today I'm going to try to finish the JS section if possible but I'm hoping to do so plus I have projects to complete in the responsive design section.
