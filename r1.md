## R1 D1

- Today I'll try my best to complete the stuff that i already know over on freecodecamp like responsive design, accessibility etc. and try my best to do most of the front end stuff but it's probably gonna take longer than a day so yeah I'm gonna commit.

- Okay so yesterday i managed to finish the topics from Applied Visual Design to CSS Grids which tbh i could have done more since i already know these things but oh well.

## R1 D2

- Okay so today I'm going to try to finish the JS section if possible but I'm hoping to do so plus I have projects to complete in the responsive design section.

- Alright so managed to finish responsive web design section and started with the basic JavaScript, wasn't able to finish the JS section entirely because i underestimated the amount of work required.

## R1 D3

- Alright so today's goal is to complete JS section but as always it might be too much still, so I'm gonna try my best.

- Okay so i did manage to finish the basics of JS section over on freecodecamp, a bit dissappointed with it since i got stuck on things that i have done before but oh well at least i got a refresher on it.
