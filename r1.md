## R1 D1

- Today I'll try my best to complete the stuff that i already know over on freecodecamp like responsive design, accessibility etc. and try my best to do most of the front end stuff but it's probably gonna take longer than a day so yeah I'm gonna commit.

- Okay so yesterday i managed to finish the topics from Applied Visual Design to CSS Grids which tbh i could have done more since i already know these things but oh well.

## R1 D2

- Okay so today I'm going to try to finish the JS section if possible but I'm hoping to do so plus I have projects to complete in the responsive design section.

- Alright so managed to finish responsive web design section and started with the basic JavaScript, wasn't able to finish the JS section entirely because i underestimated the amount of work required.

- Gonna start by completing the debugging section and then basic data structures plus since i already did 10/16 questions from basic algorithms section I'm gonna complete those first if possible.

- Onto Day 7 today I plan on finishing object oriented programming and functional programming sections.

- Next I'm gonna work on a react based project to brush up my skills.

- Okay so i did work on a react project and i finished the object oriented programming section on this day but i spent a lot of time on that react app so i wasn't able to complete functional programming section.
