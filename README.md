# I've officially joined #100DaysOfCode

- Although i have already coded for a more than a 100 days already, I've never officially committed to this challenge publicly.

- The main inspiration for me to do this is that I've never completed or gone through the pain of completing freecodecamp's curriculum, even though I have learned those things seprately, I still wanna go through them entirely

- You can follow my progress on ***[Twitter](https://twitter.com/shubhamthedev)***.
